# Student Management Database – Task 1

This project was part of my internship at Main Crafts Technology.  
In Task 1, I created the basic Student Management Database to manage student information.

A Student Management System built with SQL - includes table creation, sample data, and queries for managing student information.
This repository contains SQL scripts for creating and managing a *Student Database*.
It includes table creation, data insertion, and example queries for analysis.
